**BrowserPod** is a universal execution layer for browser-based compute, providing a sandboxed runtime API for running backend workloads directly inside the browser.

Run Node.js projects unmodified. No installation or per-session cloud sandboxes required. Execution stays inside the browser, reducing latency, infrastructure overhead, and data exposure.

## What is BrowserPod?

BrowserPod runs fully compiled language runtimes via WebAssembly inside a browser tab, preserving high fidelity with native execution. Each **Pod** is an isolated instance with:

- **Real language runtimes** running client-side at near-native speed (Node.js available now, Python, Ruby, Go, and Linux-class workloads planned)
- A **block-based streaming virtual filesystem** with familiar file and directory behavior
- **Portals** that securely expose services running inside a Pod through controlled, shareable URLs
- Browser sandbox security—isolated from the user's OS

Everything runs client-side within the browser. Users don’t need to install anything. No per-session cloud sandbox provisioning is required.

## Use Cases

- **Live product demos**: Ship demos that run real backend logic without infrastructure
- **Agentic coding and AI-generated code execution**: Run untrusted code generated by AI agents or users in a contained environment
- **Interactive tutorials and live documentation**: Let users run actual servers and see responses while learning
- **Web-based IDEs**: run package installs, dev servers, and tools in-browser
- **Browser-based "server" functions**: Run tasks that typically need cloud provisioning, like HTTP requests or API calls, entirely client-side
